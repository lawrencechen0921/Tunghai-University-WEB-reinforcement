# Tunghai-University-WEB-reinforcement

To improve the security of the overall school website, we will first make a simple crawler and confirm whether the external links of the school website can be attacked by malicious programs through the connection with the school.

The purpose is to protect the school information security issues and confirm the embarrassment. 

The number of guest intrusions or attacks can be reduced to ensure overall school operations.

# If there are any hackers or crawlers welcome to cooperate with us, find out who is behind the ghosts!
